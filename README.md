This project demonstrates an advanced image captioning system that generates highly accurate, context-aware captions using deep learning techniques. By integrating a CNN-RNN architecture with an attention mechanism, the model effectively captures intricate details of images, delivering precise and meaningful captions in real time.

Key Features:

State-of-the-Art Model: Built with a CNN-RNN architecture enhanced by an attention mechanism, significantly improving the relevance and context of the generated captions, achieving a BLEU score of 0.75.
Optimized Performance: Trained on the extensive MS COCO dataset using PyTorch, balancing high accuracy and processing efficiency for real-world deployment.
Real-Time Application: Fully integrated into a web platform, allowing users to upload images and receive captions in under 2 seconds, ensuring a smooth and responsive experience.
Technology Stack:

PyTorch for deep learning model development and training.
CNN-RNN with Attention to enhance image feature extraction and caption generation.
MS COCO Dataset for training on a large-scale image-caption pairing corpus.
Web Application for real-time user interaction and instant caption generation.
